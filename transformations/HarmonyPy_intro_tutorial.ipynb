    "    2. Data product short name (e.g. SENTINEL-1_INTERFEROGRAMS). \n",
    "* `spatial`: Bounding box spatial constraints on the data. The Harmony `Bbox` class accepts spatial coordinates as decimal degrees in w, s, e, n order, where longitude = -180, 180 and latitude = -90, 90.   \n",
    "* `shape`: Perform a shapefile subsetting request on a supported collection by passing the path to a GeoJSON file (*.json or .geojson), an ESRI Shapefile (.zip or .shz), or a kml file (.kml) as the \"shape\" parameter\n",
    "* `temporal`: Date/time constraints on the data. The example below demonstrates temporal start and end ranges using the python `datetime` library.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other advanced parameters that may be of interest. Note that many reformatting or advanced projection options may not be available for your requested dataset. See the [documentation](https://harmony-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for details on how to construct these parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `crs`: Reproject the output coverage to the given CRS. Recognizes CRS types that can be inferred by gdal, including EPSG codes, Proj4 strings, and OGC URLs (http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/…)\n",
    "* `interpolation`: specify the interpolation method used during reprojection and scaling\n",
    "* `scale_extent`: scale the resulting coverage either among one axis to a given extent\n",
    "* `scale_size`: scale the resulting coverage either among one axis to a given size\n",
    "* `granule_id`: The CMR Granule ID for the granule (file) which should be retrieved\n",
    "* `width`: number of columns to return in the output coverage\n",
    "* `height`: number of rows to return in the output coverage\n",
    "* `format`: the output mime type to return\n",
