This workflow can streamline collaboration for scientific & technical writing across programming languages.\nBy default, rendering the Cookbook will only act on markdown text and will not execute any code. This way, rendering the whole Cookbook will not become overly cumbersome as it grows, and there is not one single virtual environment with all the libraries required. Instead our workflow will be that as you develop a single chapter (or section), you control when you render, and can create a requirements.txt file for that chapter (or section). This will also make it much easier to port lessons that work standalone and are ready for a Cloud instance or a workshop."

    "title": "Workflow",
    "section": "GitHub Workflow",
    "text": "First let’s talk about the GitHub part of the workflow.\nWe will work in branches so as to not overwrite each other’s work, and let GitHub do what it does best.\nThe main branch will be the current approved version of the book. The main branch is what displays at https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/earthdata-cloud-cookbook.\nA nice clean workflow with branches is to consider them temporary. You pull the most recent from main, you create a branch locally, you make your edits, you commit regularly, then you push back to github.com, create a pull request for it to be merged into main, and once approved, you delete the branch on github.com and also locally. That’s the workflow we’ll walk through here. A great resource on GitHub setup and collaboration is Happy Git with R, which includes fantastic background philosophy as well as bash commands for setup, workflows, and collaboration.\nThe following assumes you’re all setup from the previous chapter.\n\nBranch setup\nFirst off, check what branch you’re on and pull the most recent edits from the main branch. If you need to switch branches, use git checkout.\ngit branch          # returns all local branches\ngit checkout main   # switch branch to main\ngit pull            # pull most recent from the main branch\nIf you are already on the main branch, git will tell you, and that’s fine.\n(If you have any residual branches from before, you’ll likely want to start off by deleting them — assuming they were temporary and have been merged into github.com. You can delete a branch with git branch -d branch-name).\nNext, create a new branch, then switch to that branch to work in. Below is a one-step approach for the two-step process of git branch branch-name then git checkout branch-name (read more).\ngit checkout -b branch-name  # create and switch to new branch\n\n\nDevelop content\nTime to edit and develop content, and run your Quarto Workflow – see specific instructions below. While you’re developing, you’ll want to frequently commit your changes.\n\n\nCommit changes\nYou’ll commit your work regularly as you go, likely using the following, which commits all files you’ve affected within the Cookbook project:\ngit add --all \ngit commit -m \"my commit message here\" \nFrom R Packages:\n\nA commit takes a snapshot of your code at a specified point in time. Using a Git commit is like using anchors and other protection when climbing. If you’re crossing a dangerous rock face you want to make sure you’ve used protection to catch you if you fall. Commits play a similar role: if you make a mistake, you can’t fall past the previous commit.\n\nHere are some of Hadley Wickham’s suggested best practices\n\n\nPush changes\nWhen you’re ready to push changes you’ve made in your branch, you’ll first need to connect it to github.com by pushing it “upstream” to the “origin repository” (-u below is short for --set-upstream):\ngit push -u origin branch-name  # connect your branch to github.com and push\n\n\nPull Request\nNow you’ve synced your work to github.com. It is currently online, in a separate branch from the main branch. Go to https://github.com/nasa-openscapes/earthdata-cloud-cookbook, find your branch, and do a pull request.\nTODO: Let’s discuss our review process:\n\nTag someone to review, (including you if it’s a quick fix?)\nTimeline\nMerging\n\nWhen the pull request is merged, delete the branch on github.com. GitHub will prompt you with a button at the end of the merge.\n\n\nDelete Branch\nOnce your pull request is merged and you’ve deleted the branch from github.com, then come back to your local setup and delete the branch locally:\ngit checkout main         # switch to the main branch\ngit pull                  # pull merged updates from github.com\ngit branch -d branch-name # delete old local  branch"

    "text": "Now the fun part! Our overall workflow will be to serve the book at the beginning, develop/edit chapters as simple text files (.md/.qmd/.Rmd) or executable notebooks (.ipynb) that will all render into the book.\nQuarto lets us easily convert between file types, so depending on how you prefer to work and how you’d like to interact with different audiences, we can go between formats as we wish. For example, we can converting an existing .ipynb to .qmd to collaborate during development, and then convert back to .ipynb files for our workshops. See quarto convert help for details.\nAs you work, you’ll follow our GitHub workflow above, committing regularly. And you can optionally use quarto render to rebuild the whole Cookbook before pushing to github.com.\nThe following is to run Quarto from the command line; see quarto.org to see equivalents in R.\n\nQuarto serve\nThe thing to do first is to “serve” the Cookbook so that we can see what it looks like as we develop the chapters (it’s called “serve” because it’s really a website that looks like a book).\nRun the following from your branch in your earthdata-cloud-cookbook directory from the command line:\nquarto serve\nAnd after it’s is served, you can click from the console (or paste the url into your browser) to see the development version of the Cookbook.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis command line instance is now being used to serve Quarto\n\n\n\nYou can open another instance to continue working from the command line, including running other shell commands and rendering (see next). Launching your command line shell of choice will open a new instance.\n\n\n\n\nDevelop Cookbook Content\nYou can develop Cookbook chapters as text files (.md/.qmd/.Rmd) in the text editor of your choice. You can also develop chapters as .ipynb from JupyterLab, Anaconda, etc (see more about JupyterLab with Quarto).\n\nRStudio IDE & Visual Editor\nYou can also use the RStudio IDE. It can be used as a simple text editor, but it can also interactively execute code in .qmd and .Rmd files — which are plain text files. This will streamline testing and collaboration as we develop content.\nThe RStudio IDE Visual Editor makes this experience feel like a cross between an interactive notebook and a Google Doc:\n\n\n\nThe RStudio IDE Visual Editor with an interactive .qmd file\n\n\nAbove shows the Visual Editor in the top left pane with an interactive .qmd file. Learn more about the RStudio Visual Editor.\nAnother benefit of the RStudio IDE is that it has a docked command line (Terminal, bottom left pane), file navigation (bottom right pane) and GitHub interface (top right pane). The IDE helps keep things organized as you work, and provides a visual way to review your git commits and do common commands (see this RStudio-GitHub walk through from R for Excel Users). Note too that the image shows the second instance of the Terminal command line; the first is being used to serve Quarto.\n\n\n\nQuarto render\nAs you develop book chapters and edit files, any .md files will automatically refresh in the browser (so long as quarto serve is running)!\nTo refresh files with executable code, you’ll need to render them individually. You can do the following to render .ipynb/.qmd/.Rmd files so that they show up refreshed in the served Cookbook.\nquarto render my-document.ipynb      ## render a notebook\nquarto render my-work.qmd            ## render a Quarto file\nquarto render my-contribution.Rmd    ## render a RMarkdown file\nFrom the RStudio IDE, you can also press the Render button to render .qmd and .Rmd files.\nAnd you can also render the whole book:\nquarto render\nLearn more about rendering with Quarto. From J.J. Allaire:\n\nThe reason Quarto doesn’t render .Rmd and .qmd on save is that render could (potentially) be very long running and that cost shouldn’t be imposed on you whenever you save. Here we are talking about the age old debate of whether computational markdown should be rendered on save when running a development server. Quarto currently doesn’t do this to give the user a choice between an expensive render and a cheap save."

By adding YAML as a raw text cell at the top of an .ipynb file, you can control whether it is executed or not. Adding execute: false to the YAML at the top of the file basically means that Quarto never runs the code, but the user of course still can interactively in Jupyter.\nUsing .qmd there are also ways to control execution cell-by-cell via # | syntax within a code chunk; see https://quarto.org/docs/computations/execution-options.html"

Quarto makes collaborating to create technical documentation streamlined because we work in plain text documents that can have executable code (Python, R) and are rendered using Jupyter and Knitr engines.\nWhat is Quarto? Quarto builds from what RStudio learned from RMarkdown but enables different engines (Jupyter and knitr). It is both a Command Line Tool and R package. .qmd is a new filetype like .Rmd — meaning it’s a text file but coupled with an engine can execute code and be rendered as html, pdf, word, and beyond — but for other languages like Python. Quarto can convert .ipynb files to and from .md and .qmd easily so you can develop and publish with collaborators that have different workflows. Once the book is “served” locally, .md files auto-update as you edit, and files with executable code can be rendered individually, and the behavior of different code chunks can be controlled and cached.\n(Note: with Quarto, e-books and websites are very similarly structured, with e-books being set up for numbered chapters and references and websites set up for higher number of pages and organization. We can talk about our book as a book even as we explore whether book/website better suits our needs. This is assigned in _quarto.yml, as we’ll explore later)."

The combined measurement enables global observations of the land every 2–3 days at 30-meter (m) spatial resolution. The HLS project uses a set of algorithms to obtain seamless products from OLI and MSI that include atmospheric correction, cloud and cloud-shadow masking, spatial co-registration and common gridding, illumination and view angle normalization, and spectral bandpass adjustment. HLSL30 product provides 30-m Nadir Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF)-Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR) and is derived from Landsat 8 OLI data products. The HLSS30 (https://doi.org/10.5067/HLS/HLSS30.015) and HLSL30 products are gridded to the same resolution and Military Grid Reference System (MGRS) (https://hls.gsfc.nasa.gov/products-description/tiling-system/) tiling system, and thus are “stackable” for time series analysis.HLSL30 product is provided in Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) format, and each band is distributed as a separate file. There are 10 bands included in the HLSL30 product along with one quality assessment (QA) band and four angle bands.
