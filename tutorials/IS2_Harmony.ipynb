    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will use NASA's Earthdata Harmony Services to subset and access data using the `harmony-py` Python library. We will subset the [ATL03 Global Geolocated Photon Data](https://nsidc.org/data/atl03/versions/6) product from the [ICESat-2 mission](https://nsidc.org/data/icesat-2) as an example. Please see [Demonstration for working with TEMPO data via Harmony-py](https://nasa.github.io/ASDC_Data_and_User_Services/TEMPO/tempo_with_harmony-py_clean.html) as a complimentary tutorial highlighting Harmony services for the [TEMPO mission](https://asdc.larc.nasa.gov/project/TEMPO). \n",
    "\n",
    "**What is Harmony?**  [Harmony](https://harmony.earthdata.nasa.gov/) is a service that allows you to customize many NASA datasets, including the ability to subset, reproject and reformat files.  Data can be subsetted for a geographic region, a temporal range and by variable.  Data can be \"reprojected\" from its native coordinate reference system (CRS) to the coordinate reference system relevant to your analysis.  And data can be reformatted from its native file format to a format that is more relevant for your application.  These services are collectively called _transformation services_.  However, not all services are available for all datasets.  You will learn how to discover which services are available for a given dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data transformed by Harmony services are staged on NASA Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 buckets or on user-owned AWS S3 buckets.  Data in NASA S3 buckets are accessed using signed URLs or temporary access credentials.  This data can be downloaded to your local machine or you can access the data directly if you are working in an AWS cloud instance, such as a Jupyter Hub, in AWS `us-west-2`.  "
