## Cookies and consent

This website uses a cookie consent banner powered by [TermsFeed Cookie Consent](https://www.cookieconsent.com/). When you first visit the site, you are asked to accept or reject cookies. Your preferences are saved in a cookie so they persist across visits. You can change your preferences at any time using the "Cookie Preferences" link in the footer of each page.

By default, functionality and analytics cookies are enabled. Advertising and targeting cookies are disabled and cannot be enabled.

## Analytics

This site uses [Google Analytics](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/) to collect anonymous usage data, including pages visited, time spent on each page, and referring websites. This data helps us understand how the site is used so we can improve its content and structure. Analytics cookies are only set after you accept cookies via the consent banner.

The information collected is aggregated and anonymous. It does not identify individual visitors. IP addresses are anonymized. Google Analytics may transfer data to servers in the United States, where it is processed in accordance with [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

## No advertising or targeting

This site does not use cookies for advertising, ad personalization, or user targeting. Google's advertising consent signals (`ad_storage`, `ad_user_data`, `ad_personalization`) are permanently set to denied, and ad click identifiers are redacted via `ads_data_redaction`. These settings are enforced at the Google tag level and cannot be overridden by cookie consent choices.

## Opting out

You can decline all non-essential cookies via the consent banner or the "Cookie Preferences" link in the footer. You can also opt out of Google Analytics entirely by installing the [Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).
