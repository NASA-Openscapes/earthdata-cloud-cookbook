title: How to Add Folks to the 2i2c Hub
---

We use GitHub Teams to manage access to the 2i2c Hub. To accomplish this, we use a dedicated GitHub Organization - [nasa-openscapes-workshops](https://github.com/nasa-openscapes-workshops) - with [GitHub Teams](https://github.com/orgs/nasa-openscapes-workshops/teams) for admin (people who can add others to the Hub), workshop participants, Champions Cohorts, and long term access.

People are given Openscapes 2i2c JupyterHub access for workshops run by NASA Openscapes Mentors. This is the workflow to add individual users one by one. When we have a list of workshop participants, there are quicker ways to add all at once; we'll document that after testing.

## 1. Share Google Form with participants

Ask participants: Please add your GitHub Username to this [Google form](https://forms.gle/XRPsKiqaZC4bkYoi8) for NASA Openscapes JupyterHub Access.

## 2. Google Form response setup

Set the form responses [Openscapes_JupyterHubAccess](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1xeSEv_NWIay00M8wWp5NSCFxGtIZvLd148VuRMwPYSs/edit#response=ACYDBNibER-tNcT6dFTmMU54wY9-yl2B-W3kYhQH2PMv_y7uUDbjg1u22FeO0qLZAJIC9BY) to notify when there are responses. Also do this for any separate sheets used for workshop JupyterHub registration<!--- [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ipMjDIk7B7oiwanThwXjA_m2JvKA0wbGE01u-Azu75A/edit#gid=1514300535) ---> Click on Responses \> click three vertical dots and then check "email notification."

## 3. Email alert of new signup

When you get an email click '**view response**' (not `view summary`)

## 4. Copy GitHub username

On the response page, copy the Github Username ![](images/google-form-gh-username.png){fig-alt="alt text goes here" width="406"}

## 5. Add GitHub username to a GitHub Team

For workshop participants, go to the [WorkshopAccess-2i2c Team](https://github.com/orgs/nasa-openscapes-workshops/teams/workshopaccess-2i2c) in GitHub \> Click Add member \> Paste GitHub username. Note there are a separate [GitHub Teams](https://github.com/orgs/nasa-openscapes-workshops/teams) for Champions Cohorts and long term access.

GitHub will ask you for 2-factor authentication for the first one you add in a batch, not after that.

People may see invitation notifications in two ways. They must accept the invitation to be able to access the Hub. This is what it looks like in their email inbox:

This is what the invitation looks like in the GitHub website interface - clicking the yellow banner notification leads to the invitation:

## 6. Email confirmation

Go back to the form and grab their email address. Send one of the following emails to the person.

**Email for workshop specific:** 

> Subject: NASA Openscapes Access to 2i2c Hub\
> Hi \[FIRST NAME\],
>
> I have added you to the NASA Openscapes GitHub Organization's Workshop Team. Please check your email and accept this invitation from GitHub. Once you have joined the team, you will be able to access the JupyterHub.\
> - Here is the link to the hub: <https://openscapes.2i2c.cloud/>\
> - Here is the material for the Workshop NAME\> <https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/2023-ssc/>.
>
> Have a great workshop,

...

**Email for General requests:** 

> Subject: NASA Openscapes Access to 2i2c Hub Hi \[FIRST NAME\],
>
> I have added you to the NASA Openscapes 2i2c Jupyter Hub. Here is the link to the hub: <https://openscapes.2i2c.cloud/> 
>
> There is a getting started guide in the NASA Earthdata Cloud Cookbook here: <https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/earthdata-cloud-cookbook/>
>
> We'd love to know about the kind of work you are doing on the hub, and I'll follow up in the next few months. 

> Best,

## 7. Register date in Form Response Sheet

In the [Form Response Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10Qg8YtUegXs9bepJzvK4UN54bX8BLXTrhxsjb2uV_6k/edit?resourcekey#gid=1824163684), in Column G add the date they were added to the Hub - in part so that we as admins knew if someone had already fulfilled the request. Rows 453+ are the most recent, but it can vary. Check Column A for the date of the form request.

## Directions for workshop participants

1.  Please go to <https://github.com/nasa-openscapes-workshops>

2.  Click the big yellow bar that says "you've been invited" 

3.  Not seeing that bar? 

    1.  Are you logged into [GitHub.com](https://github.com)?

    2.  Have you shared your GitHub username via [this form](https://forms.gle/XRPsKiqaZC4bkYoi8)?

    3.  You can also check your email that you use for GitHub and look for an invitation from GitHub and NASA-Openscapes

## Troubleshooting

### Users get 403 error

This is a common issue. User must find email notification from GitHub and accept invitation. If they had clicked in email to accept but did not complete accepting in GitHub, edit their invitation in GitHub to uninvite and reinvite. They should get new email to accept.

### Didn't get email

Go to <https://github.com/nasa-openscapes-workshops>, see the big yellow bar that says You're invited.
