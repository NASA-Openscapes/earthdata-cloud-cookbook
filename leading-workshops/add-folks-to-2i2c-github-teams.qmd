<!--
Move out of leading-workshops - Create "Administration" chapter
Three patterns: 
- One-offs (Long-Term-Access in NASA-Openscapes)
- Workshops
- Cohorts
-->

We use GitHub Teams to manage access to the 2i2c Hub. There are three different patterns
of access:

1. [Individually-managed long-term access for NASA-Openscapes mentors and others](#individual-long-term-access)
2. Access for participants in a NASA-Openscapes champions cohort
3. Access for participants in a workshop

We are also working on a method to give just-in-time access for specific workshops
without using GitHub teams or other managed access. Details of this process will 
added as we finalize it.

## Individual long-term access

Individuals are given long-term access by adding them as members of the 
[LongtermAccess-2i2c team in the NASA-Openscapes organization](https://github.com/orgs/NASA-Openscapes/teams/longtermaccess-2i2c).

This is the workflow to add individual users one by one.

### 1. Share Google Form with participants

Ask participants: Please add your GitHub Username to this [Google form](https://forms.gle/htV2PxJwRaP8jDpC6) for NASA Openscapes JupyterHub Access. Requests also come 
in via email from NASA mentors.

### 2. Google Form response setup

Set the form responses [Openscapes_JupyterHubAccess](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1P_EudQKv3VzoceNSZLv1a3hHM59bZNIvCnwDEeKKvY4/edit#response=ACYDBNiewOAkYG0UxG2XcAmnfnWclek1AAtHeze3mxyaFBF0znCbwqf1TZA6IMHrkGeOXJo) to notify when there are responses. Also do this for any separate sheets used for workshop JupyterHub registration<!--- [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ipMjDIk7B7oiwanThwXjA_m2JvKA0wbGE01u-Azu75A/edit#gid=1514300535) ---> Click on Responses \> click three vertical dots and then check "email notification."

### 3. Email alert of new signup

When you get an email click '**view response**' (not `view summary`)

![](images/google-form-view-response.png){fig-alt="alt text goes here" fig-align="center" width="436"}

### 4. Copy GitHub username

On the response page, copy the Github Username ![](images/google-form-gh-username.png){fig-alt="alt text goes here" width="406"}

### 5. Add GitHub username to a GitHub Team

For long-term access, go to the [LongtermAccess-2i2c Team](https://github.com/orgs/nasa-openscapes/teams/longtermaccess-2i2c) in GitHub \> Click Add member \> Paste GitHub username. Note there are a separate [GitHub Teams](https://github.com/orgs/nasa-openscapes-workshops/teams) for Champions Cohorts and individual workshops.

![](images/github-add-to-team.png){fig-alt="alt text goes here" fig-align="center" width="436"}

GitHub will ask you for 2-factor authentication for the first one you add in a batch, not after that.

People may see invitation notifications in two ways. They must accept the invitation to be able to access the Hub. This is what it looks like in their email inbox:

This is what the invitation looks like in the GitHub website interface - clicking the yellow banner notification leads to the invitation:

![](images/github-notification-banner-part2.png){fig-align="center" width="85%"}

### 6. Email confirmation

Go back to the form and grab their email address. Send one of the following emails to the person.

**Email for General requests:** 

> Subject: NASA Openscapes Access to 2i2c Hub Hi \[FIRST NAME\],
>
> I have added you to the NASA Openscapes 2i2c Jupyter Hub. Here is the link to the hub: <https://openscapes.2i2c.cloud/> 
>
> There is a getting started guide in the NASA Earthdata Cloud Cookbook here: <https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/earthdata-cloud-cookbook/>
>
> We'd love to know about the kind of work you are doing on the hub, and I'll follow up in the next few months. 

> Best,

... 

**Email for workshop specific:** 

> Subject: NASA Openscapes Access to 2i2c Hub\
> Hi \[FIRST NAME\],
>
> I have added you to the NASA Openscapes GitHub Organization's Workshop Team. Please check your email and accept this invitation from GitHub. Once you have joined the team, you will be able to access the JupyterHub.\
> - Here is the link to the hub: <https://openscapes.2i2c.cloud/>\
> - Here is the material for the Workshop NAME\> <https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/2023-ssc/>.
>
> Have a great workshop,

...


### 7. Register date in Form Response Sheet

In the [Form Response Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TgokoQa-jYncYSOjeYoWYRuDAbyo4uUR-MSzUotvM00/edit?resourcekey#gid=1416760746), in Column G add the date they were added to the Hub, or if the request came via 
email add a new row - in part so that we as admins knew if someone had already fulfilled the request. Check Column A for the date of the form request.

### Directions for workshop participants

1.  Please go to <https://github.com/nasa-openscapes-workshops>

2.  Click the big yellow bar that says "you've been invited" 

3.  Not seeing that bar? 

    1.  Are you logged into [GitHub.com](https://github.com)?

    2.  Have you shared your GitHub username via [this form](https://forms.gle/XRPsKiqaZC4bkYoi8)?

    3.  You can also check your email that you use for GitHub and look for an invitation from GitHub and NASA-Openscapes

### Troubleshooting

#### Users get 403 error

This is a common issue. User must find email notification from GitHub and accept invitation. If they had clicked in email to accept but did not complete accepting in GitHub, edit their invitation in GitHub to uninvite and reinvite. They should get new email to accept.

#### Didn't get email

Go to <https://github.com/nasa-openscapes-workshops>, see the big yellow bar that says You're invited. 

### Notes on process and any issues

Yuvi has started documenting the issues we are running into here -\> <https://hackmd.io/tWfqVai4SDC1CbQ4mhfIbw> 




## Adding workshop participants or Champions cohorts as a batch

To accomplish this, we use a dedicated GitHub Organization - [nasa-openscapes-workshops](https://github.com/nasa-openscapes-workshops) - with [GitHub Teams](https://github.com/orgs/nasa-openscapes-workshops/teams) for admin (people who can add others to the Hub), workshop participants, Champions Cohorts, and long term access.

People are given Openscapes 2i2c JupyterHub access for workshops run by NASA Openscapes Mentors.

## 1. Create a team in [nasa-openscapes-workshops](https://github.com/orgs/nasa-openscapes-workshops/teams)

There are several teams in this organization; the `AdminTeam` team is for 
members who have permission to create teams and add members to teams.

- If this is for a one-off workshop, name the team `[workshop-name]-[workshop-date]`, with 
workshop date in the format `yyyy-mm-dd`
- If this is for a new champions cohort, name the team `nasa-champtions-yyyy`

## 2. Add teams to 2i2c Hub configuration

Make a pull request to the [common.values.yaml](https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/blob/main/config/clusters/openscapes/common.values.yaml) file, adding the new team
to the `allowed-teams` item in whichever sections are appropriate for your
workshop/cohort:

- `display_name: Python`
- `display_name: R`
- `display_name: Matlab`
- `display_name: "Bring your own image"`

These will dictate which images are available to participants when they log in 
to the hub.

Team specification is in the form `[github-org]:[team]` (e.g., `nasa-openscapes-workshops:champions-access-2i2c-2024`)

You also need to add the team to the `allowed_organizations` item under 
`hub > config > GitHubOAuthenticator`

You can see an example pull request [here](https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/pull/3944).
