When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.\n\nTry executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot(cars)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](rmd-example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nAdd a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the [**toolbar**]{.ul} or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.\n\nWhen you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).\n\nThe preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.",
