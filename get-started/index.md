---

There are several things you need to set up to get started with this cookbook. This includes XYZ that are included in this section.

Different workflows: UI and programmatic.

## Prerequisites and related resources

For programmatic access to NASA data on the cloud, we recommend familiarity with the following:

Basic Programming in R or Python through Carpentries:

-   [**Introduction to Open Data Science with R**](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/open-science-with-r/)
-   [**Introduction to Geospatial Raster and Vector Data with Python**](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/geospatial-python/)

Using both the Scientific Python Ecosystem and Cloud Computing together:

-   [**Project Pythia Foundations Book**](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/landing-page.html)
-   [**Jupyter meets Earth**](https://jupytearth.org/)

## Cloud Optimized Data Formats

Some great info here about Cloud Optimized Data Formats.

-   [**Cloud-Performant NetCDF4/HDF5 Reading with the Zarr Library**](https://medium.com/pangeo/cloud-performant-reading-of-netcdf4-hdf5-data-using-the-zarr-library-1a95c5c92314)

## SW3 Buckets, etc

-   [**NASA AWS Cloud Primer**](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/user-resources/webinars-and-tutorials/cloud-primer)
